## Description

Data analysis upon 50,000+ entries of textual data related to customer reviews of Universal Studios (Florida, Japan, Singapore).

Additionally, machine learning was used for natural language processing and for making a Multinomial Naive Bayes model that predicts star ratings of a given review.

## Technology Used

- Python 3
  - Libraries: NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, NLTK, scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Motivation

At the time this project was created, I recently went to a theme park, so I was inspired to leverage my knowledge of machine learning and textual data analysis towards real-life data, customer reviews of Universal Studios Florida/Japan/Singapore.
